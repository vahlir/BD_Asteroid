source ~/pygame_venv/bin/activate

source ~/pygame_venv/bin/activate

Excellent question! When you restart your terminal and want to work on this project again, you'll need to reactivate the virtual environment. Here's what you'll need to do:

Navigate to your project directory:
cd path/to/BD_Asteroid

Activate the virtual environment:
source ~/pygame_venv/bin/activate

After running these commands, you should see (pygame_venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is activated. Now pygame will be available for your Python scripts.

When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply typing:

deactivate

I recommend creating a simple note or README file in your project folder with these commands so you don't have to remember them each time. This is a common workflow when working with Python projects that use virtual environments
